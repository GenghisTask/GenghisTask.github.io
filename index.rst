What is it ?
------------

GenghisTask is an open source, lightweight and secured replacement for
tools such as `Jenkins <https://www.jenkins.io/>`__,
`Visual-tom <https://www.absyss.com/>`__ or `Crontab
UI <https://lifepluslinux.blogspot.com/2015/06/crontab-ui-easy-and-safe-way-to-manage.html>`__.
These tools are already nice CIs or schedulers and in GenghisTask, you
will find again their traditional use case :

* Launch a periodic rsync backup of a folder 
* Manage tasks with an UI, know whatâ€™s going on and debug without hassle

New use cases :

* I need to launch my collection of usefull script on demand unscheduled 
* I need a centralized way to manage the several  crontab and tasks of several server 
* I need rollback, version control and continuous integration of the new tasks 
* I have security concerns and should no be able to inject arbitrary code into a crontab via a web ui  
* I need to launch the task via HTTP as a Hook (or as a Lambda) 
* I need to run a script in any language, even if the scheduler source code is in an other language.
